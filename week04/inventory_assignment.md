layout: assignment
description: Visualize the building inventory dataset
---

Using matplotlib, construct a visualization of the Illinois Building Inventory
that communicates the following information:

 * Relationship between the year acquired and the year constructed
 * Total square footage as a function of congressional district
 * Average square footage per floor as a function of congressional district
 * Square footage for the five most common departments as a function of year

Each component will be worth 5 points and *must* be a completely communicative
visualization -- including labels and a one paragraph writeup of successes and
shortcomings in your approach.  Submit a notebook to Moodle.  All source code
must be in these files.
